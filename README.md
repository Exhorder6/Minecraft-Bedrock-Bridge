# Minecraft_phantom_GUI
a GUI based entirely on Electron.

The phantom is a bridge for you to be able to connect Minecraft bedrock to Xbox, Playstation, and other devices to any server that Minecraft itself does not recognize as official.

this program is based entirely on the [jhead/phantom software](https://github.com/jhead/phantom).

This is not an official program of the project but simplifies the writing of the commands.
